# Public Sphere Technologies

## Introduction:
Why, when humanity can work together to meet and exceed our wildest dreams, do we continue to behave as petty tribes, violating one another, for the sake of artifically scarce resources? 
Our hypothesis is that while humanity has developed abundant means to feed and to shelter herself, we have yet to develop the necessary infrastructure to enunciate a shared story for who we are, and for what we should be doing with one another. 
Fortunately, the current era of telecommunications AI and the internet affords humanity with all that we require to finally compose an equitable and sustainable global discourse system.

## Hypothesis
From this perspective, global peace and prosperity is, at root, a networking problem. 
Figure 1 displays this concept in the abstract. As we move from left to right across the figure, humanity leverages novel communications devices (dashed and dotted lines) to incrementally build a more fully inter-connected and collaborative species. 
The leftmost panel depicts the state of nature, wherein physical co-location allows vocal communication to establish tribes. 
The center panel describes any of several high-utility/low-availability communications systems that facilitate long-range connections between tribes.
Examples of these communications systems include, e.g.: printing presses, telegraph and rail lines, congressional seats, social media servers, etc.
Critically, these types of communications systems have been very costly to create and to maintain. 
Thus, few individuals obtain to these communications systems.
Those who do will act as hubs, mediating interactions between local and remote tribes.
The rightmost panel leverages high-utility/high-availability communications systems -- e.g. digital networks -- to allow people to communicate at-will with any and all other persons.

| *Figure 1* displays three kinds of social network topographies. Part A features four disconnected tribes. Each tribe's internal connections are produced through person-to-person contact and communication. Part B includes several long-range connections (dashed lines) between certain members (black diamonds) of each tribe. Each well-connected tribal member is a hub, filtering communication between their and the other tribes. Moreover, the high degree of connectivity among tribal hubs creates a "rich-club" supporting internal collusion. This network topography is the current state of most long-range social networks -- e.g., representative democracies, the UN, OPEC, etc. Part C depicts a network model wherein all participants may communicate with any other member in just two steps (dotted lines) via a common database (circumferential ring).|

## Approach
*Public Sphere Tech* comprises a suite of applications to facilitate scalable coordination. 
Each application builds upon prior progress towards the long-term vision of a global citizenry auto-generating and assenting to a set of equitable and sustainable norms.
The immediate application development goals are described in the following milestones.

### Milestone 1: I/O Systems Foundations, OriginTrail + SingularityNET
#### Part 1.1: General system configuration

#### Part 1.2: Integration with CHSI (Collective Human SuperIntelligence)

#### Part 1.3: Integration with RnDAO TogetherCrew Knowledge Graph

### Milestone 2: 

### Milestone 3:

### Milestone 4:
