# Public Sphere Technologies

## Introduction:
Why, when humanity can work together to meet and exceed our wildest dreams, do we continue to behave as petty tribes, violating each other, for the sake of resources made artifically scarce? 
Our hypothesis is that even while humanity has developed abundant means to feed and to shelter herself, we have yet to develop the necessary infrastructure to enunciate a shared story for who we are, and for what we should be doing with one another.
Absent such a shared outlook, and the means for developing it, we exist in a perpetual state of individualist anarchy.
One wherein violence is still observed to bear short term profit.
Fortunately, the current era of telecommunications, AI, and the internet affords humanity with all that we require to finally compose an equitable and sustainable global system of discourse.

## Hypothesis
From this perspective, global peace and prosperity is, at root, a networking problem. 
One having evident engineering solutions.
Figure 1 displays this concept in the abstract. As we move from left to right across the figure, humanity leverages novel communications devices (dashed and dotted lines) to incrementally build a more fully inter-connected and collaborative species. 
The leftmost panel depicts the state of nature, wherein physical co-location allows vocal communication to establish tribes. 
The center panel describes any of several high-utility/high-cost communications systems that facilitate long-range connections between tribes.
Examples of these communications systems include, e.g.: printing presses, telegraph and rail lines, congressional seats, social media servers, etc.
Owing to the high costs of building these systems, the few individuals who govern them will act as hubs, mediating interactions between their local and other remote tribes.
These types of networks are termed "small-world."
The term denotes the proliferation of local clustering (the tribes), alongside the existence of key long-range connections between clusters (the hubs).
Critically, if the hubs, themselves, are clustered together; the small-world network may also posess a "rich-club."
The rightmost panel leverages high-utility/low-cost communications systems -- e.g. digital networks -- which allow all people to coordinate, at-will, with any and all other persons.
This type of network may be considered "fully connected," albiet, with individual interest and attention filtering information flow between each person and the mutually-accessible digital I/O communications backbone.

| *Figure 1* displays three kinds of social network topology. Part A features four disconnected tribes (blue, red, green, and magenta). Each tribe's internal connections are produced through person-to-person contact and communication (solid lines). Part B includes several long-range connections (dashed lines) between certain members (black diamonds) of each tribe. Each well-connected tribal member is a hub, filtering communication between their own tribal members and the hubs of other tribes. Critically, the high degree of connectivity among tribal hubs creates a "rich-club" montage that may devolve into collusion among the individuals who act as hubs. Rich-club network topologies are the current configuration of most long-range social networks -- e.g., representative democracies, the UN, OPEC, etc. Part C depicts a network model wherein all participants may communicate with any other member in just two steps (dotted lines) via a common database (circumferential ring).|

## Long-term Goal: Detailing the Global Public Sphere
Transitioning from a small-world to a fully-connecteded global civil society could be accomplished very quickly, provided that pre-existing hubs decide to involve themselves in accelerating this transition.
Already, ~65% of the global population has access to the internet.
And reltatively small capital investments could push these numbers very close to 100% connectivity. 
The ease of this transition begs the question, "why is humanity yet to achieve a fully-connected global civil society?"
Very likely, the transition away from humanity's reliance on privelaged hubs is not a transition that privelaged hubs are eager to accelerate.
How many rationally self-interested persons have the foresight to empower all people towards a more verdant and sustainable tomorrow?

Fortunately, a wide range of grass-roots efforts are well underway to effectuate large-scale collective intelligence.
The most critical of these efforts are systems that establish distributed I/O, i.e., distributed ledger technologies and the distributed applications (dapps) that utilize them.
These systems establish a high-utility/low-cost I/O layer, through which any and all persons may interact with one another.
But whereas these systems provide a means for people to interact, "big-data" is notoriously difficult to handle, sensably.
This impasse raise a second critical tool: computational techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence (especially Large-Language Models (LLMs)).
When combined, distributed I/O systems and modern computational techniques provide everything necessary for grass-roots communities to link humanity together into an ongoing global conversation.
Armed with these tools, humanity is well-posed to amass amid a common (digital) congress, to shout as loud as each would please about whatever may be in their hearts, and to resolve that cocaphany into the details of a just and sustainable global political economy.

## Near-term Goals
*Public Sphere Tech* (PST) comprises a suite of applications to facilitate scalable coordination. 
Each application builds towards the long-term vision of a "global public sphere" wherein a global citizenry auto-generate and assents to a set of equitable and sustainable norms.
The immediate application development goals are described in the following milestones.

### Milestone 1: I/O Systems Foundations: OriginTrail + SingularityNET
A natural place to begin is with the integration of data storage and data analysis tools into a common framework.
And, whereas the ultimate goal of PST is to build trustless and scalable information I/O tools, it makes sense to utilize distributed information systems as a core design feature.
The state-of-the-art in blockchain-native information I/O tools are 1) OriginTrail Distributed Knowledge Graphs, and 2) SingularityNET distributed AI analytics applications.
To this end, milestone one installs and configures OriginTrail + SingularityNET to host a suite of user-facing information I/O tools.
As a proof-of-concept: milestone 1 recruits a pre-existing information analytics tool from a partner organizations: Collective Human SuperIntelligence (CHSI) by radish.org. 
#### Part 1.1: General system configuration
The foundation of Public Sphere Tech is robust, on-chain, I/O infrastructure. 
To this end, following steps install and configure state-of-the-art blockchain-native I/O tools onto a bare-metal node.
This node will be used to test and to launch user-facing public sphere applications.
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.1.1: Configure OriginTrail Node
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.1.2: Configure SingularityNet Node
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.1.3: Test local communication between OriginTrail data and SingularityNet analysis
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.1.4: Test on-chain communication between OriginTrail data and SingularityNet analysis

#### Part 1.2: Integration with CHSI (Collective Human SuperIntelligence)
CHSI is an independent project built by Victor Piper and Jaemen Shen. 
The aim of the application is to connect individuals holding shared interests; so as to catalyze the proliferation of those interests.
At root, the application transforms vocal conversations into a knowledge graph describing the topics of those conversations.
These knowledge assets may be compared to suggest to participants likely inividuals, from other conversations, who share similar interests.
This, with the goal of connecting individuals into common interest groups.
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.2.1: Ingest spoken conversation uploads
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.2.2: Convert spoken conversation into text transcription
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.2.3: Convert text transcript into knowledge graph
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.2.4: Add conversation knowledge graph to DKG 
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.2.5: Visually analyze knowledge assets for commonalities
  ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 1.2.6: Create front-end-interface for visual analytics

### Milestone 2: Sustainable Business: AI assisted Proposal Generation and Review
The focus of milestone 2 is to build a sustainable business, while also furthering our group's capacities to facilitate multi-agent negotiations.
One clear community to orient towards is exactly the market of small groups engaged in very detailed negotiations: i.e. the market of grant (or proposal) authorship and review.
This community faces several key hurdles which are well-served by more adept information I/O:
- Hurdle 1: Once a good idea is concieved, proposals are time consuming to format to meet review criteria.
- Hurdle 2: Once a propsal is submitted, the review process is also time-consuming.
- Hurdle 3: Once reviews are submitted, it is not always the case that proposal authors will immediately understand the importance of reviewer critiques.  

Authors and reviewers, alike, are increasingly turning towards large-language models to help in the proposal process.
However, the tendency for LLM's to hallucinate makes their routine use in mission-critical communications hazerdous.
Milestone 2, therefore, aims to formalize the use of LLM's in proposal authorship and review by treating the proposal as a deterministic data object that constrains the LLM's generative output.
The most natural way of accomplishing this goal is to translate proposals into a data object that both humans and LLM's can understand, i.e., into graph database.
The technical term for leveraging external graph databases to constrain LLM generative ouputs is

NSAI leverages external Knowledge Bases (KB) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to fine-tune generative responses. With NSAI, proposers would be asked to (use an LLM to) restructure their proposal into a knowledge graph, as in: "Work plan A meets review criteria X. Deliverables A1, A2, and A3 are parts of work plan A. Deliverable A1, has challenges Z. Challenge Z is addressed by methods Z1, Z2, Z3." etc. 
Immediately, reviewers, and AI, would have a more structured way of consuming proposals. 
Additionally, challenges observed by reviewers (w/wo AI assistance) may be added to the graph, as in: "Method Z1 faces challenge R1." 
Given an iterative review process, the KB could be reviewed until all issues are fully addressed.

NSAI represents the state-in-the-art in AI fine-tuning. 
And, whereas much of the debate around the use of generative AI stems from its propensity to make irrelevant and responses, it seems clear that layering a structured knowledge database between generative AI and semi-structured prose is a great way of leveraging AI in governance and decision making.
Moreover, proposal ROI is poorly balanced between reviewer needs to have as detailed and comprehensive a proposal as practical, and realistic proposer needs to seek funding by drafting proposal for multiple agencies. 
Formalizing the use of AI in facilitating complex document collaboration stands to reduce the cost of composing proposals, reduce the time to review proposals, and increase the re-usability of proposals, all while ensuring that advocates arrive at the best proposals possible. 

Certainly, AI has been put to this effort before, albeit with limited results. 
One common use case of AI in governance is to provide a summary of proposal text. 
While this technique does provide a convenient way of introducing proposals to reviewers, often, the most critical aspects of a proposal lies in its filtered details.
The alternative proposed, herein, leverages the state-of-the-art in AI. 
As such, most of the existing use cases are still embedded in the academic literaturei. 
At least one enterprise is offering NSAI consultations for commercial clients ii. 
While a leading KB software provider, Neo4j, is publishing their early progress in NSAI to their open-source git repositoriesiii.
Still absent are user-friendly platforms that guide authors and reviewers through the grant submission and review process. 
The current proposal apples open-source advances in state-of-the-art AI to solve standing problems for distributed self-governance. 
While none of the technologies proposed here-in are novel in their own right, their novel combination stands to make the proposal authorship and review process much more efficient and engaging.

### Milestone 3: Publicity and Engagement: Visually Analysis of Large-Scale Social Networks
Milestone 3 aims to drive public-interest and engagement with PST.
To do so, we will produce an application having both a low barrier of entry and also a high degree of social stimulation.
Specifically, the application will ingest each user's pre-existing social-media data, and translate that data into a user-specific KG.
From there, the application will allow users to visually analyze areas of overlap (and any gaps) between their KG and the KG's from other users populating our expanding database.
