Why, when humanity can work together to exceed our wildest dreams, do we continue to behave as petty tribes, violating each other, for the sake of artifically scarce resources? 
Our hypothesis is that humanity has yet to develop the necessary infrastructure to enunciate a shared story for who we are, and for what we should be doing now and in the future. 
Fortunately, this era of telecommunications AI and the internet affords us with all that we require to finally converse with the whole of humanity.

From this perspective, global peace and prosperity is a networking problem. Figure 1 displays, in the abstract, a story of four tribes --  an abstract model of

And, until this infrastructure is built, individual nations exist in a state of ungovernable anarchy with respect to one another.
Under such a condition, capitalistic and militaristic imperialism may yet achieve short-term gains for local populations.
But as humanity emerges into a global civil society, the essentially destructive practices of today may be understood to be a cancer that drags each and every one further and further into crisis.


Absence the under which self-interested agents may work in opposition to one another with the hope of achieving short-term gains.

The sun provides more energy per day that we might otherwise develope in cooperation? In the long term, natural resources are practically limitless. 

In the wake of WWII psychologists and sociologists alike asked this very question. And now, as humanity faces several more anthropogenic metacrises, we might look to conclusions of the past in order to discover how to arrive at a more sustainable and cooperative tomorrow.
